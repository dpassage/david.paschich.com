                  Implemented processes to turn a one-man engineering effort
                  into a collaborative coding environment, with bug tracking,
                  automated testing, and continuous integration. Built
                  functionality allowing organizations to manage their own
                  election endorsements&mdash;the necessary next step in
                  PollVault’s path to revenue. Built with Python, Django, and
